As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $\t875\tmillion and $\t1.6\tbillion, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\tUnder master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $\t2.8\tbillion and $\t2.7\tbillion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $\t312\tmillion and $\t407\tmillion, respectively.\tAccounts Receivable\tTrade Receivables\tThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\tAs of both September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had\tno\tcustomers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company s cellular network carriers accounted for\t51\t% of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2019.\tVendor Non-Trade Receivables\tThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had\ttwo\tvendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for\t57\t% and\t11\t%. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had\ttwo\tvendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for\t59\t% and\t14\t%.\tNote 4 \u2013\tConsolidated Financial Statement Details\tThe following tables show the Company s consolidated financial statement details as of September 26, 202"
