To manage this risk, we may hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure related to outstanding monetary assets and liabilities as well as forecasted product sales using foreign currency exchange forward or option contracts. In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. The credit risk associated with these contracts is driven by changes in interest and currency exchange rates and, as a result, varies over time. By working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market conditions, we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform. We also seek to limit our risk of loss by entering into contracts that permit net settlement at maturity. Therefore, our overall risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrealized gains on outstanding contracts (i.e., those contracts that have a positive fair value) at the date of default. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes.\tWe hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency. The derivative instruments we use to hedge this exposure are not designated as hedges and, as a result, changes in their fair value are recorded in Other income (expense), net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\tWe hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for forecasted product sales that are denominated in a non-functional currency. The derivative instruments we use to hedge this exposure are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of\t18\tmonths or less. Upon executing a hedging contract and quarterly thereafter,",
