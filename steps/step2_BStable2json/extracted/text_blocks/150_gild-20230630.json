Our investment in Galapagos is classified in Other long-term assets due to certain lock-up provisions in our amended subscription agreement with them, which extend to August 2024.\tOther Equity Securities\tEquity method investments and other equity investments without readily determinable fair values were $\t366\tmillion and $\t423\tmillion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and were excluded from the table above.

To manage this risk, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures related to outstanding monetary assets and liabilities as well as forecasted product sales using foreign currency exchange forward contracts. In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. The credit risk associated with these contracts is driven by changes in interest and currency exchange rates and, as a result, varies over time. By working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market conditions, we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform. We also seek to limit our risk of loss by entering into contracts that",
