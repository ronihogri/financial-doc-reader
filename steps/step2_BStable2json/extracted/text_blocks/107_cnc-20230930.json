The majority of the liabilities were previously reported as debt and other long-term liabilities.\tDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill associated with the pending divestiture of $\t251\tmillion, or $\t269\tmillion after-tax.\tIn order to manage the foreign exchange risk on the sale price associated with the pending divestiture of Circle Health, in August 2023 the Company entered into a foreign currency swap agreement for a notional amount of $\t931\tmillion, to sell \u00a3\t740\tmillion. The swap agreement was formally designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge. The swap expires on March 28, 2024. The gain or loss due to changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap is recorded in other comprehensive income until the Circle Health divestiture closes, at which time the gain or loss will be recorded in earnings to the same line in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the gain or loss on sale. The fair value of the swap agreement as of September 30, 2023 was $\t27\tmillion, which was recorded in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\t8\tTable of Contents\t3.\tShort-term and Long-term Investments, Restricted Deposits\tShort-term and long-term investments and restricted deposits by investment type consist of the following ($ in millions):\tSeptember 30, 2023\tDecember 31, 2022\tAmortized Cost\tGross\tUnrealized Gains\tGross\tUnrealized Losses\tFair Value\tAmortized Cost\tGross\tUnrealized Gains\tGross\tUnrealized Losses\tFair Value\tDebt securities:\tU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of\tU.S. government corporations and agencies\t$\t421\t$\t \t$\t(\t13\t)\t$\t408\t$\t695\t$\t \t$\t(\t16\t)\t$\t679\tCorporate securities\t9,922\t2\t(\t750\t)\t9,174\t10,127\t12\t(\t778\t)\t9,361\tRestricted certificates of deposit\t4\t \t \t4\t4\t \t \t4\tRestricted cash equivalents\t260\t \t \t260\t256\t \t \t256\tShort-term time deposits\t470\t \t \t470\t204\t \t \t204\tMunicipal securities\t3,931\t1\t(\t294\t)\t3,638\t4,055\t6\t(\t280\t)\t3,781\tAsset-backed securities\t1,633\t2\t(\t52\t)\t1,583\t1,396\t \t(\t70\t)\t1,326\tResidential mortgage-backed securities\t1,475\t \t(\t172\t)\t1,303\t1,165\t2\t(\t121\t)\t1,046\tCommercial mortgage-backed securities\t1,100\t \t(\t112\t)\t988\t961\t \t(\t99\t)\t862\tEquity securities\t2\t \t \t2\t5\t \t \t5\tPrivate equity investments\t810\t \t \t810\t529\t \t \t529\tLife insurance contracts\t178\t \t \t178\t169\t \t \t169\tTotal\t$\t20,206\t$\t5\t$\t(\t1,393\t)\t$\t18,818\t$\t19,566\t$\t20\t$\t(\t1,364\t)\t$\t18,222\tThe Company's investments are debt securities classified as available-for-sale with the exception of equity securities, certain private equity investments, and life insurance contracts.
