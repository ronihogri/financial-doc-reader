Additionally, we have agreed to maintain a cash balance of $\t2.96\tbillion that, together with any borrowings under the bridge credit agreement and term loan credit agreement, represents sources of funds available to finance the acquisition.\tOn January 30, 2023, the Company and Horizon each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (Second Request) from the FTC in connection with the FTC s review of the Company s proposed acquisition of Horizon. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, until 30 days after the Company and Horizon have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the Company and Horizon or terminated sooner by the FTC.\tAcquisition of ChemoCentryx, Inc.\tOn October 20, 2022, we acquired all the outstanding stock of ChemoCentryx, a publicly traded biotechnology company focused on orally-administered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer, for $\t52.00\tper share in cash, representing a total consideration of $\t3.9\tbillion.

TAVNEOS is commercialized by us in the United States; for markets outside the United States, TAVNEOS is commercialized by a collaboration partner, and Amgen is entitled to royalties and milestones based off future sales of the product. Upon its acquisition, ChemoCentryx became a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, and its operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date.\tDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred approximately $\t106\tmillion of costs directly related to the acquisition of ChemoCentryx, consisting of share-based payments to settle non-vested equity awards attributable to post-combination services, severance and other transaction costs.
