            "Consolidated Balance Sheets.\t3.\tAcquisitions and divestitures\tAcquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc\tOn October 6, 2023, Amgen completed its acquisition of Horizon for $\t116.50\tper share in cash, representing a total consideration of approximately $\t27.8\tbillion. The acquisition was funded primarily through our March 2023 debt issuance and borrowings from our term loan credit agreement. See Note 16, Financing arrangements. Horizon is a global biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of medicines that address critical needs of patients impacted by rare, autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. The acquisition, which was accounted for as a business combination, aligns with Amgen s core strategy of delivering innovative medicines that make a significant difference for patients suffering from serious diseases and strengthens Amgen s leading rare disease portfolio by adding first-in-class, early-in-lifecycle medicines, including TEPEZZA for thyroid eye disease, KRYSTEXXA for chronic refractory gout and UPLIZNA for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Upon its acquisition, Horizon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, and its operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date.\tDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred approximately $\t487\tmillion of acquisition costs related to the closing of our Horizon acquisition, consisting of $\t167\tmillion for share-based payments to settle non-vested equity awards attributable to post-combination services, severance and other employee-related expenses, and $\t320\tmillion of transaction costs. These costs were included primarily in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\tF-15\tThe following table summarizes the total consideration and allocated acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions):\tAmounts\tCash and cash equivalents\t$\t681\tInventories\t5,025\tProperty, plant and equipment, net\t318\tFinite-lived intangible assets \u2013 developed-product-technology rights\t19,590\tIPR&D\t1,060\tGoodwill\t3,111\tDeferred tax asset\t834\tDeferred tax liability\t(\t2,492\t)\tOther assets and liabilities, net\t(\t294\t)\tTotal assets acquired, net\t$\t27,833\tThe $\t27.8\tbillion total consideration for this transaction consisted of (i) cash consideration transferred to common shareholders of $\t26.7\tbillion; (ii) cash consideration transferred to vested and outstanding options, outstanding RSU awards, and outstanding PSU awards of $\t523\tmillion; (iii) fair value of Amgen replacement awards (based on conversion of outstanding employee RSU awards) of $\t180\tmillion representing non-cash consideration; and (iv) a portion of Horizon s debt, settled by Amgen on the closing date, of $\t382\tmillion. Amgen issued\t1.7\tmillion replacement equity awards with the original vesting conditions, and fair value was determined based on acquisition date fair value based on the conversion calc",
