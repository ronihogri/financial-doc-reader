            "Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities.\tOther\tIn connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is\t$94 million\t. We recorded a liability of\t$17 million\tas of\tMay 2, 2020\tand\tFebruary 1, 2020\t, and\t$10 million\tas of\tMay 4, 2019\trelated to these guarantee obligations.  This liability is included in Current Operating Lease Liabilities on the\tMay 2, 2020\tand\tFebruary 1, 2020\tConsolidated Balance Sheets, and in Long-term Operating Lease Liabilities on the\tMay 4, 2019\tConsolidated Balance Sheet.\tContractual Obligations\tOur contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and the related interest payments, operating leases, purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other long-term obligations. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since\tFebruary 1, 2020\t, as discussed in \u201cContingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations\u201d in our\t2019\tAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of our contractual obligations may fluctuate during the normal course of business (primarily changes in our merchandise inventory-related purchase obligations, which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of our operations).\tRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\tCredit Losses\tIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,\tFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\twhich requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\t34\tTable of Contents\tGuarantor Reporting\tIn March 2020, the SEC issued a final rule,\tFinancial Disclosures About Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant s Securities\t, that simplifies the disclosure requirements related to registered securities under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X.  The rule replaces the requirement to provide condensed consolidating financial information with a requirement to present summarized financial information of the issuers and guarantors.  It also requires qualitative disclosures with respect to information about guarantors, the terms and conditions of guarantees and the factors that may affect payment.  These disclosures may be provided outside the footnotes to the Company s consolidated financial statements.  We early adopted the reporting requirements of the rule in the first quarter of fiscal 2"
