            "Consolidated Balance Sheets.  During the second quarter of 2021, the Company terminated these lending commitments which released the restrictions on this cash.  Accordingly, the balance was reclassified to Cash and Cash Equivalents during the second quarter of 2021.\tAs of July 31, 2021, the Company's total Cash and Cash Equivalents and restricted cash totaled $\t2.588\tbillion.\tDerivative Financial Instruments\tThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\tThe earnings of the Company's wholly owned foreign operations are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all the merchandise is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this foreign currency exposure for its Canadian operations. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer. These gains and losses are recognized in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). The fair value of designated cash flow hedges is not significant for any period presented.\tConcentration of Credit Risk\tThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. The Company s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.\tThe Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company determines the required allowance for expected credit losses using information such as customer credit history and financial condition. Amounts are recorded to the allowance when it is determined that expected credit losses may occur.\t9\tTable of Contents\tUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\tThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.\tR"
