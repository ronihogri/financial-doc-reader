            "Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019.\tRestricted cash totaling $\t236\tmillion is included in the \"Other assets\" line of our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018.\tSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\t5\tTable of Contents\tNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\tConocoPhillips\tNote 1 Basis of Presentation\tThe interim-period financial information presented in the financial statements included in this report is unaudited and, in the opinion of management, includes all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips and its results of operations and cash flows for such periods. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial statements included in this report. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\tNote 2 Changes in Accounting Principles\tWe adopted the provisions of FASB ASU No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases,\u201d and its amendments set forth by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-01, \u201cLand Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,\u201d ASU No. 2018-10, \u201cCodification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,\u201d ASU No. 2018-11, \u201cTargeted Improvements,\u201d ASU No. 2018-20, \u201cNarrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors,\u201d and ASU No. 2019-01, \u201cCodification Improvements,\u201d collectively FASB ASC Topic 842, \u201cLeases\u201d (ASC Topic 842), beginning January 1, 2019.\tASC Topic 842 establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements, supersedes the existing requirements in FASB ASC Topic 840, \u201cLeases\u201d (ASC Topic 840), and requires lessees to recognize substantially all lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The provisions of ASC Topic 842 also modify the definition of a lease and outline requirements for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangements by both lessees and lessors.\tWe adopted ASC Topic 842 using the modified retrospective approach and elected to utilize the Optional Transition Method, which permits us to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 842 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after January 1, 2019, and present in our financial statements comparative periods prior to January 1, 2019 under the historical requirements of ASC Topic 840. In addition, we elected to adopt the package of optional transition-related practical expedients, which among other things, allows us to carry forward certain historical conclusions reached under ASC Topic 840 regarding lease identification, classification, and the accounting treatment of initial direct costs. Furthermore, we elected not to record assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for new or existing lease arrangements with terms of 12 months or less",
