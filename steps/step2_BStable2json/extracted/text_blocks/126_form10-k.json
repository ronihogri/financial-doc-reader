Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\tThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A.\u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\tEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\tGeneral\tWe are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.\tResults of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. We measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. The health benefits ratio (HBR) represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided. The SG&A expense ratio represents SG&A costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed.\tOn\tDecember 12, 2018\t, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on\tFebruary 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 24, 2018\t. All share, per share and stock price information presented in this Form 10-K has been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split.\tFidelis Care Acquisition\tOn July 1, 2018, we\tacquired substantially all of the assets of New York State Catholic Health Plan, Inc., d/b/a Fidelis Care New York (Fidelis Care) for approximately\t$\t3.6 billion\tof cash consideration,\twhich includes a working capital adjustment\t. The cash consideration was funded through\tapproximately $2.8 billion\tof new equity, and\tapproximately $1.8 billion\tof new long-term debt. Both offerings were complete",
