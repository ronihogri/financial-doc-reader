            "Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 30, 2022, January 29, 2022 and July 31, 2021:\tJuly 30,\t2022\tJanuary 29,\t2022\tJuly 31,\t2021\t(in millions)\tCash and Cash Equivalents\t$\t452\t$\t1,979\t$\t1,695\tCurrent Assets of Discontinued Operations\t \t \t893\tTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\t$\t452\t$\t1,979\t$\t2,588\tDerivative Financial Instruments\tThe Company's Canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all the Company's merchandise sold in Canada is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions.  The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this foreign currency exposure. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer. These gains and losses are recognized in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All designated cash flow hedges are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The fair value of designated cash flow hedges is not significant for any period presented. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\tConcentration of Credit Risk\tThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. The Company s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.\tThe Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company determines the required allowance for expected credit losses using information such as customer credit history and financial condition. Amounts are recorded to the allowance when it is determined that expected credit losses may occur.\tUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\tThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.\tRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\tThe Company did not adopt any new accounting standards in 2022 that had a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

            "Consolidated Balance Sheet.\t(b)\tAs of July 30, 2022, our borrowing base was $730 million and we had outstanding letters of credit, which reduce our availability under the ABL Facility, of $16 million.  As of January 29, 2022, our borrowing base was $495 million and we had outstanding letters of credit of $16 million. As of July 31, 2021, we were unable to draw upon the ABL Facility as our consolidated cash balance exceeded $350 million.  In August 2021, we entered into an amendment and restatement of the ABL Facility to, among other things, remove the requirement to prepay outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility should our consolidated cash balance exceed $350 million.\tCash Flows\tThe cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated.  Accordingly, the 2021 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows include the results of continuing and discontinued operations.  We did not report any cash flows from discontinued operations year-to-date 2022.\tThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity during year-to-date 2022 and 2021:\t2022\t2021\t(in millions)\tCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash, Beginning of Period\t$\t1,979\t$\t3,933\tNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\t81\t573\tNet Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities\t(162)\t(168)\tNet Cash Flows Used for Financing Activities\t(1,446)\t(1,752)\tEffects of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\t \t2\tNet Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\t(1,527)\t(1,345)\tCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash, End of Period\t$\t452\t$\t2,588\tOperating Activities\tNet cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was $81 million, including net income of $275 million. Net income included depreciation of $106 million and share-based compensation expense of $15 million.  Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal changes in Inventories, Income Taxes Payable, Accounts Receivable, and the change in Other Assets and Liabilities.  Additionally, we proactively pulled forward the purchase and delivery of certain Inventory items to generate capacity during the third quarter of 2022 peak period, which we expect to provide us with additional agility in the second half of 2022.\tNet cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was $573 million, including total net income of $651 million (which included Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax of $345 million). Net income included depreciation of $258 million (which included $158 million related to the Victoria's Secret business classified as discontinued operations), loss on extinguishment of debt of $105 million, share-based compensation expense of $30 million (which included $15 million related to the Victoria's Secret business classified as discontinued operations), and deferred tax expense of $16 million.
