            "Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\tDividend Policy and Procedures\tOur Board of Directors will determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating activities to fund our ordinary dividends and a combination of cash flow generated from operating activities and financing activities to fund our special dividends.\tUnder the authority and declaration of our Board of Directors, we paid the following dividends during\tyear-to-date 2018\tand\t2017\t:\tOrdinary Dividends\tTotal Paid\t(per share)\t(in millions)\t2018\tThird Quarter\t$\t0.60\t$\t165\tSecond Quarter\t0.60\t167\tFirst Quarter\t0.60\t168\t2018 Total\t$\t1.80\t$\t500\t2017\tThird Quarter\t$\t0.60\t$\t172\tSecond Quarter\t0.60\t172\tFirst Quarter\t0.60\t172\t2017 Total\t$\t1.80\t$\t516\t46\tTable of Contents\tIn November 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors plans to reduce our annual ordinary dividend to $1.20 per share from $2.40 per share currently, beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in March 2019.\tCash Flow\tThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity for\tyear-to-date 2018\tand\t2017\t:\tYear-to-Date\t2018\t2017\t(in millions)\tCash and Cash Equivalents, Beginning of Period\t$\t1,515\t$\t1,934\tNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\t13\t138\tNet Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities\t(538\t)\t(581\t)\tNet Cash Flows Used for Financing Activities\t(643\t)\t(758\t)\tEffects of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash and Cash Equivalents\t1\t2\tNet Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents\t(1,167\t)\t(1,199\t)\tCash and Cash Equivalents, End of Period\t$\t348\t$\t735\tOperating Activities\tNet cash provided by operating activities in\t2018\twas\t$13 million\t, including net income of\t$104 million\t. Net income included depreciation of\t$444 million\t, long-lived store asset impairment charges of $81 million and share-based compensation expense of\t$75 million\t. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal changes in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable), as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year. In addition, our Income Taxes Payable decrease was due to seasonal tax payments.\tNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $138 million, including net income of $319 million. Net income included depreciation and amortization of $426 million and share-based compensation expense of $74 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital.
