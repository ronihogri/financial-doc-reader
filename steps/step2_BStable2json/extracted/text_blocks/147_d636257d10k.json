We expect to recognize the contract liabilities as of December 31, 2018, as revenue between the remainder of 2019 and 2022 as construction is completed.\tPrior to the adoption of ASC Topic 606, contractual cash payments received were recognized as \u201cSales and other operating revenues\u201d when received.\tNote 25 Segment Disclosures and Related Information\tWe explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. We manage our operations\nthrough six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.\tCorporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums on early retirement of debt,\ncorporate overhead and certain technology activities, including licensing revenues. Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\tWe evaluate performance and allocate resources based on net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. Segment accounting policies are the same as those in\nNote 1 Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.\t147\tTable of Contents\tAnalysis of Results by Operating Segment\tMillions of Dollars\t2018\t2017\t2016\tSales and Other Operating Revenues\tAlaska\t$\t5,740\t4,224\t3,681\tLower 48\t17,029\t12,968\t10,719\tIntersegment eliminations\t(40)\t(4)\t(17)\tLower 48\t16,989\t12,964\t10,702\tCanada\t3,184\t3,178\t2,192\tIntersegment eliminations\t(1,160)\t(559)\t(218)\tCanada\t2,024\t2,619\t1,974\tEurope and North Africa\t6,635\t5,181\t3,462\tAsia Pacific and Middle East\t4,861\t4,014\t3,705\tCorporate and Other\t168\t104\t169\tConsolidated sales and other operating revenues\t$\t36,417\t29,106\t23,693\tDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Impairments\tAlaska\t$\t760\t1,026\t868\tLower 48\t2,370\t6,693\t4,358\tCanada\t324\t461\t975\tEurope and North Africa\t1,041\t1,313\t1,253\tAsia Pacific and Middle East\t1,382\t3,819\t1,606\tOther International\t-\t-\t1\tCorporate and Other\t106\t134\t140\tConsolidated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairments\t$\t5,983\t13,446\t9,201\tIn 2018, sales by our Lower 48, Alaska and Canada segments to a certain refining company accounted for approximately\n$4 billion or 11 percent of our total consolidated sales and other operating revenues.\t148\tTable of Contents\tMillions of Dollars\t2018\t2017\t2016\tEquity in Earnings of Affiliates\tAlaska\t$\t6\t7\t9\tLower 48\t1\t5\t(6\t)\tCanada\t-\t197\t89\tEurope and North Africa\t16\t10\t22\tAsia Pacific and Middle East\t1,051\t553\t(51\t)\tOther International\t-\t-\t-\tCorporate and Other\t-\t-\t(11\t)\tConsolidated equity in earnings of affiliates\t$\t1,074\t772\t52\tIncome Taxes\tAlaska\t$\t376\t(689\t)\t(59\t)\tLower 48\t47"
