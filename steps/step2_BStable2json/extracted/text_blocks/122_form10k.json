Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\tThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A.\"Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis does not include certain items related to the year ended December 31, 2017, including year-to-year comparisons between the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017. For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019.\tEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\tGeneral\tWe are a leading multi-national healthcare enterprise that is committed to helping people live healthier lives. We take a local approach - with local brands and local teams - to provide fully integrated, high-quality, and cost-effective services to government-sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals.\tResults of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. We measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. The health benefits ratio (HBR) represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided. The SG&A expense ratio represents SG&A costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed.\tOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to the Affordable Care Act annual health insurer fee (HIF), absent a HIF moratorium. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) imposed the HIF in 2018, however the HIF was suspended in 2019. In 2018, we recognized revenue for reimbursement",
