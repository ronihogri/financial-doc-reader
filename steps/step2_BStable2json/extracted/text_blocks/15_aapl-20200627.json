The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\tAs of both June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had\tno\tcustomers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company s cellular network carriers accounted for\t32\t% and\t51\t% of total trade receivables as of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively.\tVendor Non-Trade Receivables\tThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of June 27, 2020, the Company had\tthree\tvendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for\t49\t%,\t18\t% and\t11\t%.
