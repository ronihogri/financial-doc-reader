Our investment in Arcus was classified in Prepaid and other current assets as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our investment in Galapagos is subject to certain lock-up provisions until August 2024 and was classified in Prepaid and other current assets and in Other long-term assets as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\tOther Equity Securities\tEquity method investments and other equity investments without readily determinable fair values were $\t337\tmillion and $\t423\tmillion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and were excluded from the table above.

The Foundation is a related party as certain of our officers also serve as directors of the Foundation. The donation expense of $\t85\tmillion was recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\t16\t5.\tDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\tOur operations in foreign countries expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. To manage this risk, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures related to outstanding monetary assets and liabilities as well as forecasted product sales using foreign currency exchange forward contracts. In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. The credit risk associated with these contracts is driven by changes in interest and currency exchange rates and, as a result, varies over time. By working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market conditions, we seek to limit the risk that counterparties t",
