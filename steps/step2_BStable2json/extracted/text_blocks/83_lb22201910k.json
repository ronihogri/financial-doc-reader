            "Consolidated Balance Sheets.\tThe Company receives construction allowances from landlords related to its retail stores. These allowances are generally comprised of cash amounts received by the Company from its landlords as part of the negotiated lease terms. The Company records a receivable and a landlord allowance at the lease commencement date (date of initial possession of the store). The landlord allowance is amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease (including the pre-opening build-out period), and the receivable is reduced as amounts are received from the landlord. The Company s unamortized portion of landlord allowances, which totaled\t$278 million\tas of\tFebruary 2, 2019\tand\t$293 million\tas of\tFebruary 3, 2018\t, is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\tThe Company also has leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the initial lease term. Leasehold improvements made after the inception of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured.\tFor information regarding the future impacts as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC 842,\tLeases,\tin the first quarter of 2019, refer to Note 2, \"New Accounting Pronouncements.\"\tForeign Currency Translation\tThe functional currency of the Company s foreign operations is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The Company s resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders  equity.  Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to net income when realized upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity.\tDerivative Financial Instruments\tThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\tFor derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders  equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Gains and losses that are reclassified into earnings are recognized in the same line item on the Consolidated Statement of Income as the underlying h",

These balances will change as the lease portfolio changes due to execution of lease modifications or new leases.  The right-of-use\t64\tTable of Contents\tassets are based upon the lease liabilities adjusted for deferred rent liabilities and unamortized landlord construction allowances.  The Company will continue to recognize rent expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\tHedging Activities\tIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,\tTargeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities\t, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\tGoodwill\tIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,\tSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\t, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge will be the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\t3. Revenue Recognition\tIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606,\tRevenue from Contracts with Customers\t, using the modified retrospective approach. Results for 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period consolidated financial statements have not been adjusted and continue to be presented under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\tAccounts receivable, net from revenue-generating activities were\t$150 million\tas of\tFebruary 2, 2019\tand\t$144 million\tas of the beginning of the period upon adoption of the new standard. Accounts receivable primarily relate to amounts due from the Company's franchise, license and wholesale partners. Under these arrangements, payment terms are typically 60 to 75 days.\tThe Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received in advance of transfer of control of goods or services. Deferred revenue primarily relates to gift cards, loyalty and private lab",
