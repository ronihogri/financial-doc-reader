            "Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contingent consideration was estimated using probability-weighted scenarios for FDA approval.\t15\tThe fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon valuations using information known and knowable as of the date of this filing. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could cause an impact to the valuation of assets acquired, including intangible assets, goodwill and the related tax impacts of the acquisition, as well as legal and other contingencies. The amounts recognized will be finalized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained, but no later than one year after the acquisition date.\tThe following table summarizes estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:\t(in millions)\tAmount\tIntangible assets\tFinite-lived intangible asset\t$\t845\tAcquired IPR&D\t1,190\tDeferred income taxes, net\t(\t513\t)\tOther assets (and liabilities), net\t(\t187\t)\tTotal identifiable net assets\t1,335\tGoodwill\t226\tTotal consideration\t$\t1,561\tIntangible Assets\tThe finite-lived intangible asset of $\t845\tmillion represents the estimated fair value of Hepcludex for HDV in Europe as of the acquisition date. The fair value was determined by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to Hepcludex for HDV in Europe and a discount rate of\t12\t%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value this intangible asset. This intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of\t10\tyears.\tAcquired intangible assets related to IPR&D consist of Hepcludex for HDV in all other regions without regulatory approval, including the U.S. The estimated aggregate fair value of $\t1.2\tbillion as of the acquisition date was determined by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to this asset and a discount rate of\t12\t%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value this intangible asset.\tSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset fair values include: estimates of projected future cash flows including revenues and operating profits; probability of success; the discount rate selected; the life of the potential commercialized products and the risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets, among other factors.\tIntangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived assets until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts.\tThe inputs used for valuing these identifiable intangibles are unobservable and considered Level 3 under the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance.\tDeferred Income Taxes\tThe net deferred tax liability was based upon the difference between the estim"
