            "Consolidated Balance Sheets for such matters as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\tIncome Taxes\tWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made.\tWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws. For example, the United States enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law will continue to significantly affect us. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.\t47\tWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. An adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.\tSee Note 18. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\tOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\tWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\tCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\tContractual obligations represent future cash commitments related to significant enforceable and legally binding obligations and certain purchase obligations that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they may be cancelable. The expected timing and payment amounts presented below are estimated based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.\tThe following table summarizes the aggregate maturities of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\tPayments due by Period\t(In millions)\tTotal\t2021\t2022-2023\t2024-2025\tThereafter\tDebt\t(1)\t$\t46,410\t$\t3,752\t$\t7,595\t$\t5,142\t$",
