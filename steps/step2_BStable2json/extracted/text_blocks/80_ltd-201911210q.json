The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows.\tHedging Activities\tIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,\tTargeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities\t, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\tGoodwill\tIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,\tSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\t, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge will be the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  We adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed our interim goodwill impairment assessment in accordance with ASU 2017-04.\tCredit Losses\tIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,\tFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\twhich requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard.\tIMPACT OF INFLATION\tWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.\tCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\tThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenu"
