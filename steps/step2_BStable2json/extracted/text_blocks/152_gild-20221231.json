In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. The credit risk associated with these contracts is driven by changes in interest and currency exchange rates and, as a result, varies over time. By working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market conditions, we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform.

The fair value was determined by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to Hepcludex for HDV in Europe and a discount rate of\t12\t%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value this intangible asset. This intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of\t10\tyears.\tAcquired IPR&D consists of Hepcludex for HDV in all other regions without regulatory approval, including the United States.

The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value this intangible asset.\tDeferred Income Taxes\tThe net deferred tax liability was based upon the difference between the estimated financial statement basis and tax basis of net assets acquired and an estimate for the final pre-acquisition net operating losses of MYR.\tGoodwill\tThe excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of $\t226\tmillion was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.
