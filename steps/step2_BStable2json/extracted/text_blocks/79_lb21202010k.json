            "Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities.\tOther\tIn connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is\t$94 million\t. We recorded a liability of\t$17 million\tand\t$11 million\trelated to these guarantee obligations as of\tFebruary 1, 2020\tand\tFebruary 2, 2019\t, respectively.  This liability is included in Current Operating Lease Liabilities on the\tFebruary 1, 2020\tConsolidated Balance Sheet, and in Other Long-term Liabilities on the\tFebruary 2, 2019\tConsolidated Balance Sheet.\tOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\tWe have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).\tRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\tLeases\tIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASC 842,\tLeases\t, which requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expense on their income statement in a manner similar to legacy accounting. The standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases.  In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a modified retrospective transition option that did not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption.\tWe adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective approach.  As allowed by the new standard, we elected the package of transition practical expedients but elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition.\tUpon adoption at the beginning of 2019, we recorded operating lease liabilities of\t$3.7 billion\tand operating lease assets for its leases of\t$3.3 billion\t.  The operating lease assets are net of\t$470 million\tof liabilities for deferred rent and unamortized landlord construction allowances that were previously recorded as Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We also recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of\t$2 million\t.  The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows.\tHedging Activities\tIn August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-12,\tTargeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities\t, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships.

The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows.\tHedging Activities\tIn August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-12,\tTargeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities\t, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\tGoodwill\tIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,\tSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\t, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  We adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed our interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments in accordance with ASU 2017-04.\t54\tTable of Contents\tCredit Losses\tIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,\tFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\twhich requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\tImpact of Inflation\tWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.\tCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\tThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
