All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial statements included in this report. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\tNote 2 Inventories\tMillions of Dollars\tSeptember 30\t2023\tDecember 31\t2022\tCrude oil and natural gas\t$\t664\t641\tMaterials and supplies\t662\t578\tTotal inventories\t$\t1,326\t1,219\tInventories valued on the LIFO basis\t$\t374\t396\tNote 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions\tAcquisitions\tSurmont\tOn October 4, 2023, we completed our acquisition of the remaining\t50\tpercent working interest in Surmont from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd.\tFair value of consideration for the transaction was approximately $\t3.0\tbillion after customary adjustments (CAD $\t4.1\tbillion):\tFair value of consideration\tBillions of Dollars\tCash paid\t$\t2.7\tContingent consideration\t0.3\tTotal Consideration\t$\t3.0\tThe transaction will be accounted for as a business combination under FASB ASC 805 using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values.\tThe contingent payment arrangement requires additional consideration to be paid to TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. up to $\t0.4\tbillion CAD ($\t0.3\tbillion) over a\tfive-year\tterm. The contingent payments represent $\t2.0\tmillion for every dollar that WCS pricing exceeds $\t52\tper barrel during the month, subject to certain production targets being achieved. The range of the undiscounted amounts we could pay under the contingent consideration arrangement is between $\t0\tand $\t0.3\tbillion. The fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date was $\t0.3\tbillion and estimated by applying the income approach.\tWe are currently in the process of finalizing the initial accounting for the transaction and provisional fair value measurements will be made in the fourth quarter of 2023. We may adjust the measurements in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date as we identify additional information to complete the necessary analysis.\tConocoPhillips      2023 Q3 10-Q\t6\tNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\tTable of Contents\tQatarEnergy LNG N"
