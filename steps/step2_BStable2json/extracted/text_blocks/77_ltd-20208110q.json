            "Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The Company's total Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash was\t$\t2.739\tbillion\tas of\tAugust 1, 2020\t.\t9\tTable of Contents\tDerivative Financial Instruments\tThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\tThe earnings of the Company's wholly owned foreign businesses are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all the merchandise is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this foreign currency exposure for its Canadian and U.K. businesses.  Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer. These gains and losses are recognized in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  The fair value of designated cash flow hedges is not significant as of\tAugust 1, 2020\t.\tConcentration of Credit Risk\tThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Typically, the Company s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.\tThe Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company records an allowance for uncollectable accounts when it becomes probable that the counterparty will be unable to pay.\tUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\tThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.\t2.\tNew Accounting Pronouncements\tCredit Losses\tIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13,\tFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\twhich requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. The Company adopted the standard in the",
            "Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities.\tOther\tIn connection with the noncancelable operating lease of an operating asset, we provide a residual value guarantee to the lessor if the leased asset cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The lease expires in 2021, and the total amount of the guarantee is\t$28 million\t. We did not record a liability as of\tAugust 1, 2020\t.\tContractual Obligations\tOur contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and the related interest payments, operating leases, purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other long-term obligations. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since\tFebruary 1, 2020\t, as discussed in \u201cContingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations\u201d in our\t2019\tAnnual Report on Form 10-K, other than the newly issued 2025 Secured Notes and 2025 Notes. Certain of our contractual obligations may fluctuate during the normal course of business (primarily changes in our merchandise inventory-related purchase obligations, which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of our operations).\tRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\tCredit Losses\tIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,\tFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\twhich requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2020.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\t41\tTable of Contents\tGuarantor Reporting\tIn March 2020, the SEC issued a final rule,\tFinancial Disclosures About Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant s Securities\t, that simplifies the disclosure requirements related to registered securities under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X.  The rule replaces the requirement to provide condensed consolidating financial information with a requirement to present summarized financial information of the issuers and guarantors.  It also requires qualitative disclosures with respect to information about guarantors, the terms and conditions of guarantees and the factors that may affect payment.  These disclosures may be provided outside the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.  We early adopted the reporting requirements of the rule in the first quarter of 2020 and elected to provide these disclosures in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\tIMPACT OF INFLATION\tWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inf"
