            "Consolidated Balance Sheets.\t8\t3\t.\tAcquisitions and divestitures\tAcquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc\tOn October 6, 2023, Amgen completed its acquisition of Horizon for $\t116.50\tper share in cash, representing a transaction equity value of approximately $\t27.8\tbillion. Horizon is a global biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of medicines that address critical needs of patients impacted by rare, autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. The acquisition aligns with Amgen s core strategy of delivering innovative medicines that make a significant difference for patients suffering from serious diseases and strengthens Amgen s leading inflammation portfolio by adding first-in-class, early-in-lifecycle medicines such as TEPEZZA\t\u00ae\t(teprotumumab-trbw), KRYSTEXXA\t\u00ae\t(pegloticase) and UPLIZNA\t\u00ae\t(inebilizumab-cdon), which treat rare inflammatory diseases.\tThe accounting impact of this acquisition and the results of operations for Horizon will be included in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. The initial accounting for this acquisition is incomplete, pending identification and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\tIn connection with our acquisition of Horizon, we entered into several debt and financing arrangements. See Note 10, Financing arrangements.\tAcquisition of ChemoCentryx, Inc.\tOn October 20, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of ChemoCentryx, a publicly traded biotechnology company focused on orally administered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer, for $\t52.00\tper share in cash, representing a total consideration of $\t3.9\tbillion. The acquisition, which was accounted for as a business combination, includes TAVNEOS, an orally administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in October 2021 as an adjunctive therapy for adults with severe active antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis). TAVNEOS is commercialized by us in the United States; for markets outside the United States, TAVNEOS is commercialized by a collaboration partner, and Amgen is entitled to royalties and milestones based on future sales of the product. Upon its acquisition, ChemoCentryx became a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, and its operations became included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date.\tMeasurement period adjustments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included changes in the purchase price allocation and total consideration, resulting in a net decrease of approximately $\t18\tmillion to goodwill. The measurement period adjustments resulted primarily from valuation inputs pertaining to the TAVNEOS intangible assets, adjustments to vendor payables and deferred tax attributes based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from events sub",

If these events were to occur, the counterparties would have the right, but not the obligation, to close the contracts under early-termination provisions. In such circumstances, the counterparties could request immediate settlement of these contracts for amounts that approximate the then current fair values of the contracts. In addition, our derivative contracts are not subject to any type of master netting arrangement, and amounts due either to or from a counterparty under the contracts may be offset against other amounts due either to or from the same counterparty only if an event of default or termination, as defined, were to occur.\tThe cash flow effects of our derivative contracts in the Condensed Cons"
