            "Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The Company's total Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash was $\t2.750\tbillion as of October 31, 2020.\tDerivative Financial Instruments\tThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\tThe earnings of the Company's wholly owned foreign operations are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all the merchandise is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this foreign currency exposure for its Canadian operations.  Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer. These gains and losses are recognized in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  The fair value of designated cash flow hedges is not significant as of October 31, 2020.\tConcentration of Credit Risk\tThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. The Company s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.\tThe Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company records an allowance for uncollectable accounts when it becomes probable that the counterparty will be unable to pay.\t10\tTable of Contents\tUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\tThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.\t2.\tNew Accounting Pronouncements\tCredit Losses\tIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13,\tFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\twhich requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of"
