In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\tAs of\tDecember 29, 2018\t, the Company had\tno\tcustomers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. As of\tSeptember 29, 2018\t, the Company had\tone\tcustomer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for\t10%\t.
